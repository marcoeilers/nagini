"""HTTP server classes.
Note: BaseHTTPRequestHandler doesn't implement any HTTP request; see
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler for simple implementations of GET, HEAD and POST,
and CGIHTTPRequestHandler for CGI scripts.
It does, however, optionally implement HTTP/1.1 persistent connections,
as of version 0.3.
Notes on CGIHTTPRequestHandler
------------------------------
This class implements GET and POST requests to cgi-bin scripts.
If the os.fork() function is not present (e.g. on Windows),
subprocess.Popen() is used as a fallback, with slightly altered semantics.
In all cases, the implementation is intentionally naive -- all
requests are executed synchronously.
SECURITY WARNING: DON'T USE THIS CODE UNLESS YOU ARE INSIDE A FIREWALL
-- it may execute arbitrary Python code or external programs.
Note that status code 200 is sent prior to execution of a CGI script, so
scripts cannot send other status codes such as 302 (redirect).
XXX To do:
- log requests even later (to capture byte count)
- log user-agent header and other interesting goodies
- send error log to separate file

# Log files
# ---------
#
# Here's a quote from the NCSA httpd docs about log file format.
#
# | The logfile format is as follows. Each line consists of:
# |
# | host rfc931 authuser [DD/Mon/YYYY:hh:mm:ss] "request" ddd bbbb
# |
# |        host: Either the DNS name or the IP number of the remote client
# |        rfc931: Any information returned by identd for this person,
# |                - otherwise.
# |        authuser: If user sent a userid for authentication, the user name,
# |                  - otherwise.
# |        DD: Day
# |        Mon: Month (calendar name)
# |        YYYY: Year
# |        hh: hour (24-hour format, the machine's timezone)
# |        mm: minutes
# |        ss: seconds
# |        request: The first line of the HTTP request as sent by the client.
# |        ddd: the status code returned by the server, - if not available.
# |        bbbb: the total number of bytes sent,
# |              *not including the HTTP/1.0 header*, - if not available
# |
# | You can determine the name of the file accessed through request.
#
# (Actually, the latter is only true if you know the server configuration
# at the time the request was made!)

    """HTTP request handler base class.
    The following explanation of HTTP serves to guide you through the
    code as well as to expose any misunderstandings I may have about
    HTTP (so you don't need to read the code to figure out I'm wrong
    :-).
    HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an extensible protocol on
    top of a reliable stream transport (e.g. TCP/IP).  The protocol
    recognizes three parts to a request:
    1. One line identifying the request type and path
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. An optional data part
    The headers and data are separated by a blank line.
    The first line of the request has the form
    <command> <path> <version>
    where <command> is a (case-sensitive) keyword such as GET or POST,
    <path> is a string containing path information for the request,
    and <version> should be the string "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".
    <path> is encoded using the URL encoding scheme (using %xx to signify
    the ASCII character with hex code xx).
    The specification specifies that lines are separated by CRLF but
    for compatibility with the widest range of clients recommends
    servers also handle LF.  Similarly, whitespace in the request line
    is treated sensibly (allowing multiple spaces between components
    and allowing trailing whitespace).
    Similarly, for output, lines ought to be separated by CRLF pairs
    but most clients grok LF characters just fine.
    If the first line of the request has the form
    <command> <path>
    (i.e. <version> is left out) then this is assumed to be an HTTP
    0.9 request; this form has no optional headers and data part and
    the reply consists of just the data.
    The reply form of the HTTP 1.x protocol again has three parts:
    1. One line giving the response code
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. The data
    Again, the headers and data are separated by a blank line.
    The response code line has the form
    <version> <responsecode> <responsestring>
    where <version> is the protocol version ("HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1"),
    <responsecode> is a 3-digit response code indicating success or
    failure of the request, and <responsestring> is an optional
    human-readable string explaining what the response code means.
    This server parses the request and the headers, and then calls a
    function specific to the request type (<command>).  Specifically,
    a request SPAM will be handled by a method do_SPAM().  If no
    such method exists the server sends an error response to the
    client.  If it exists, it is called with no arguments:
    do_SPAM()
    Note that the request name is case sensitive (i.e. SPAM and spam
    are different requests).
    The various request details are stored in instance variables:
    - client_address is the client IP address in the form (host,
    port);
    - command, path and version are the broken-down request line;
    - headers is an instance of email.message.Message (or a derived
    class) containing the header information;
    - rfile is a file object open for reading positioned at the
    start of the optional input data part;
    - wfile is a file object open for writing.
    IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADHERE TO THE PROTOCOL FOR WRITING!
    The first thing to be written must be the response line.  Then
    follow 0 or more header lines, then a blank line, and then the
    actual data (if any).  The meaning of the header lines depends on
    the command executed by the server; in most cases, when data is
    returned, there should be at least one header line of the form
    Content-type: <type>/<subtype>
    where <type> and <subtype> should be registered MIME types,
    e.g. "text/html" or "text/plain".
